#  HCP mapping description file
#  ----------------------------
# 
#  This file is used to specify mappings between image sequence names (e.g.
#  T1w 0.7mm N1) to the image descriptors used for sorting data in a folder
#  organization expected by the HCP minimal preprocessing pipelines. For more 
#  background information, please see help for setupHCP commands,
#  and documentation on Running HCP minimal preprocessing pipeline. 
#  
#  This file is used by getHCPReady command. The command processes subject 
#  information files (typically subject.txt) and generates a target file 
#  (default is subject_hcp).txt). The general format for mapping is: 
#
#    <original_sequence_name> => <user_speficied_label>
#
#    The code searches for presence of the <original_sequence_name> and creates a new file
#    which now contains the <user_speficied_label> mapping. Each pair of 
#    <original_sequence_name> => <user_speficied_label> provided in a separate line.
# 
#  Note that images with names that do not match the <user_speficied_label> is left empty.
# 
#  BOLD files should be given a compound label after the => separator because this allows 
#  for flexible labeling of distinct BOLD runs based on their content.
# 
#    <original_sequence_name>  => bold:<user_speficied_label>
# 
#  Here the 'bold' part denotes that it is a bold file and the <user_speficied_label>
#  allows for flexibility in naming. getHCPReady will automatically number bold images in 
#  a sequential order, starting with 1.
#
#
#  Examples
#  --------
# 
#  Example 1: If you place the following line in this file:
# 
#  T1w 0.7mm N1 => T1w
#
#  then the code would label all image sequences named "T1w 0.7mm N1" with "T1w".
# 
#  
#  Example 2: If you the following line in this file:
# 
#  03: T1w 0.7mm N1
# 
#  then the script would take the info from subject.txt (source) and add this to the 
#  subject_hcp.txt (target), thereby inserting the new label and perserving the old name.
#  
#  03: T1w             :T1w 0.7mm N1
