#  HCP mapping description file
#  ----------------------------
# 
#  This file is used to specify mappings between image sequence names (e.g.
#  T1w 0.7mm N1) to the image descriptors used for sorting data in a folder
#  organization expected by the HCP minimal preprocessing pipelines. For more 
#  background information, please see help for setupHCP and setupHCPFolder 
#  commands, and documentation on Running HCP minimal preprocessing pipeline. 
#  
#  This file is used by getHCPReady command. The command processes subject 
#  information files (typically subject.txt). It searches for presence of 
#  search text in image description and labels every image named with the search 
#  text with the stated label text. Each pair of search and label texts is to be 
#  specified in a separate line, with => as separator.
# 
# 
#  Examples
#  --------
# 
#  For example, placing the following line in this file:
# 
#  T1w 0.7mm N1 => T1w
# 
#  Would label all image sequences named "T1w 0.7mm N1" with "T1w". A line:
# 
#  03: T1w 0.7mm N1
# 
#  in subject.txt file would be changed to:
#  
#  03: T1w             :T1w 0.7mm N1
# 
#  inserting the new label and perserving the old name.
#  
#  Images with names that do not match are given empty labels.
# 
#  BOLD files should be given a compound label, e.g.:
# 
#  RSBOLD 3mm 48 2.5s  => bold:rest
#  BOLD 3mm 48 2.5s    => bold:WM
# 
#  The first part denotes that it is a bold file, the second, the kind of bold
#  image that was acquired. getHCPReady will autmatically number bold images in 
#  a sequential order, starting with 1.
#

#                      correction
#  FM-Phase        ... Field mapping phase image used for distortion
#                      correction
#  boldref[N]      ... Reference image for the following BOLD image
#  bold[N]         ... BOLD image
